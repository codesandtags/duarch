### Hi there ğŸ‘‹


Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on this new feature
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Javascript
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on go projects
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with Vim
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about the bible 
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: I'm lockdown you can't reach me now (but I receive calls, e-mail, tweets, ...)
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him (His but I don't have many stuff)
               You can call me AndrÃ©, Andy, Duarch, or Hey guy come here!
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a cuber solver
